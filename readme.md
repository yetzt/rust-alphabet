# Rust Alphabet

![collect wood](examples/collect-wood.png)

Rust Alphabet is a collection of giant letters in the style of the iconic Hollywood sign for the game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/), to be used by creators of custom game maps. It comes with basic latin letters A-Z and numerals 0-9 and includes variants of the letters W, X and Y that are typographically digressive but more akin to the original signs letter style.

## Usage

Download the file [alphabet.hdrp.prefab](alphabet.hdrp.prefab) and place it in the `RustEdit/CustomPrefabs` directory of [RustEdit](RustEdit/CustomPrefabs). The prefab can be accessed in the custom section of the prefab browser. To use sinlge letters, the prefab has to be broken up by selecting it once placed and using the *Break prefab* function. Single letters can then be used by a dragging selection over the letters full extend. In the original scale, a *Movement snap* setting of 1 is recommended.
